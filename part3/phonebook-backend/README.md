## Running the code

This exercise has been published as a container to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/milquetoast/fullstackopen-part3-phonebook-backend)
and can be run with the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 8081:3000 milquetoast/fullstackopen-part3-phonebook-backend
```

Then connect to `http://localhost:8081` in a web browser

Note that this is just a backend option to the `phonebook` app we built in [part2](https://github.com/dallasyoung/fullstackopen/tree/master/part2/phonebook).
You might consider running this app in a separate container so you have a nice
frontend you can use to access this Express server
