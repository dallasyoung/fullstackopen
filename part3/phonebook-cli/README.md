# Part 3 exercise - Command-line database

## See the exercise descriptions

  - [3.12](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/saving_data_to_mongo_db#exercise-3-12)

## Prerequisites
  - `git`
  - `node.js`

## Running the code

This exercise is a simple Node.js module that can be run with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/dallasyoung/fullstackopen
cd fullstackopen/part3/phonebook-cli
node mongo.js <password> [<name> <phonenumber>]
```

I am not giving away my Atlas' password, so in order to get a `<password>` of
your own, you'll have to review the part 3 course material, spin up your own
Atlas DB cluster, and update the source code & command with your own connection
string and password
